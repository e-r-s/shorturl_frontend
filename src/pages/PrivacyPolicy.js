    <p>Welcome to Bitly. This Privacy Policy describes the policies and procedures of Bitly, Inc. (“Bitly”, “we” or
        “us”) for the collection, use, security and disclosure of personal information about you. It also describes your
        choices regarding use, access, deletion, and correction of your personal information.</p>
    <h5 className="header-s">Scope</h5>
    <p>This Privacy Policy explains how Bitly treats the personal information it gathers when you use or access <a
            href="https://bitly.com/">https://bitly.com</a> (the “Site”) or the services, features, content or
        applications offered by Bitly (collectively with the Site, the “Services”), or when you view or interact with a
        Bitly link (either our bit.ly links or one of our branded domains). This Privacy Policy also covers Bitly’s
        treatment of any information about you that Bitly’s customers share with Bitly.</p>
    <p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of other businesses that Bitly does not own or control,
        including other companies’ websites, services and applications (“Third Party Services”) that you can access
        through the Services or to individuals that Bitly does not manage or employ. We cannot take responsibility for
        the content or privacy policies of Third Party Services. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any
        Third Party Services you access or use.</p>
    <h5 className="header-s">Information We Collect</h5>
    <p>Bitly may collect personal information about you from the following sources, as described in this Privacy Policy,
        when you (i) register for the Site and the Services, through your user account with Bitly, including registering
        through a third-party social networking service (your “Account”); (ii) use the Services; or (iii) view or
        interact with a Bitly link (either our bit.ly links or one of our branded domains) on a third-party website. We
        collect the following types of information from you, some of which might be considered personal information
        under applicable law.</p>
    <p><strong>When You Register for a Bitly Account</strong><br /> When you create an Account, we may collect personal
        information from you, such as your name, phone number, company name, industry, job title, company size, email
        address, and sign-in information. If you create an Account using your login information from a third-party
        account, such as Google, Facebook, Apple, or Twitter, we will access and collect the personal information about
        you that the third-party account provides (which is based on your privacy settings with the third-party
        account), so that you can log into your Account with us. We use your contact information to send you information
        about our Services and communicate with you about your Account, your activities on our Site and Services and
        policy changes. You may unsubscribe from receiving certain types of these messages through your Account
        settings, although Bitly reserves the right to contact you when we believe it is necessary, such as for
        administrative and account management purposes.</p>
    <p>Some features of the Services allow registered users to provide their own content to the Services, such as
        written descriptions of URLs, comments, images and video. Unless you request deletion of your personal
        information as described in this Privacy Policy, all content submitted by you to the Services may be retained by
        Bitly, even after you terminate your Account and may continue to be shared by third parties, as described in
        this Privacy Policy.</p>
    <p><strong>When You Create a Bitly Link</strong><br /> One feature of the Services is the ability to create shortened
        uniform resource locators (URLs) of websites (“Bitly Links” or “Bitlinks”). Users can create Bitly Links without
        registering for an account. When you create a Bitly Link, Bitly collects and stores both the original URL and
        the shortened URL and, if you are logged in to your Account, we will associate that information with your
        Account. Bitly also collects and stores your IP address, your geolocation data (which we derive from your IP
        address), the time and date on which you shortened the original URL, and if you share a Bitly Link on a social
        networking platform, the name of the platform and your username on that platform.</p>
    <p><strong>When You Interact With a Bitly Link</strong><br /> Bitly automatically collects personal information about
        the interaction (such as clicks or views) with every Bitly Link created through the Services (either our bit.ly
        links or one of our branded domains) on a third-party website. This information includes, but is not limited to:
        (i) the IP address and location derived from the IP address; (ii) internet or other electronic network activity
        information like the referring websites or services; (iii) the time and date of each access; (iv) device
        settings, such as browser type, operating system, and language; (v) cookies, as described below, and mobile
        advertising identiﬁers and (v) information about sharing of the Bitly Link on Third Party Services
        (collectively, “Bitly Link Metrics”). As described in this policy, we use Bitly Link Metrics to provide the
        Services, to understand and analyze how our Services are used and to identify trends, and to detect, deter and
        prevent malicious, fraudulent or unlawful activity. Please see the “Information We May Share” section of this
        Privacy Policy for a description of how we may share information we collect when you create, view or interact
        with Bitly Links.</p>
    <p><strong>Other Information We Automatically Collect</strong><br /> When you visit the Site, we automatically collect
        (i) your IP address and location derived from the IP address; (ii) internet or other electronic network activity
        information, like the referring websites or services; (iii) the time and date of each access; (iv) device
        settings, such as browser type, operating system, and language; and (v) cookie information. This type of data
        enables us and third parties authorized by us to ﬁgure out how often individuals use parts of the Site so that
        we can analyze and improve them.</p>
    <p>We may receive a conﬁrmation when you open an email from us. We use this conﬁrmation to improve our customer
        service.</p>
    <p>Bitly may use third-party APIs and software development kits (“SDKs”) to provide certain functions in our
        Services.</p>
    <p><strong>Third Party Services</strong><br /> Some features of the Services allow you to share your content and Bitly
        Links through your accounts with Third Party Services such as Twitter. If you choose to connect Bitly to such
        Third Party Services, we may collect information related to your use of those Third Party Services, such as
        authentication tokens that allow us to connect to your Third Party Service accounts. We will ask you for
        permission before you authorize our collection of this information. We will only use that information for the
        speciﬁc reason for which it was provided to us. We may also collect information about how you are using the
        Services to interact with those connected Third Party Services. Note that Third Party Services may have the
        ability to restrict the information that is provided to us based on your privacy settings of that account.</p>
    <p>To enable us to infer the location from the IP addresses of computers or devices that visit our website or click,
        view or interact with Bitly links as described in this policy, we receive IP-derived location information from
        our third-party service provider. We also receive business contact information of our business customer contacts
        and prospects from our third party service provider.</p>
    <p><strong>Cookies and Other Similar Technologies</strong><br /> Bitly and its partners use cookies or similar
        technologies to analyze trends, administer the website, track users’ movements around the website, and to gather
        demographic information about our user base as a whole.</p>
    <p>Cookies are pieces of text that may be provided to your computer through your web browser when you access a
        website. Your browser stores cookies in a manner associated with each website you visit. We use cookies to
        enable our servers to recognize your web browser and tell us how and when you visit our Site and use the
        Services through the web.</p>
    <p>Bitly cookies also allow Bitly to track when you have clicked on a Bitly Link. Each click of a Bitly Link is
        tracked using a unique identiﬁer assigned to you in one or more cookies stored by your web browser and
        associated with Bitly. We may associate the unique identiﬁer in our cookies with the other information we
        automatically collect when you use the Services, as described above, including your IP address, Bitly Links you
        click, Bitly Links you create, and information with your Account if you have one.</p>
    <p>Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting
        new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on
        acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. If you disable cookies, you will not be able to use some
        features of the Services. We do not currently recognize do-not-track signals.</p>
    <p>We partner with third parties to track utilization and behavior on the Site, and to manage our advertising on
        other websites. Our third-party partners may use cookies, web beacons, pixel tags or similar technologies in
        order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests. If you wish to opt out of
        interest-based advertising click <a href="https://preferences-mgr.trustarc.com/" target="_blank"
            rel="noopener">here</a> (<a href="https://preferences-mgr.trustarc.com/" target="_blank"
            rel="noopener">https://preferences-mgr.trustarc.com/</a>) or if located in the European Union click <a
            href="https://www.youronlinechoices.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> (<a
            href="https://www.youronlinechoices.eu/" target="_blank"
            rel="noopener">https://www.youronlinechoices.eu/</a>).</p>
    <p>This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Bitly only and does not cover the use of cookies by any Third
        Party Services. Bitly does not control when or how third parties place cookies on your computer, such as when
        you visit a website through a Bitly Link. You can manage other companies’ cookies used for online advertising by
        visiting the Digital Advertising Alliance’s <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/" target="_blank"
            rel="noopener">Consumer Choice Page</a> (<a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/" target="_blank"
            rel="noopener">http://www.aboutads.info/choices/</a>).</p>
    <p><strong>Opt-Out Mechanisms</strong><br /> You may ask Bitly not to associate your web browser or IP address with
        visits to the Bitly.com website or Bitly Links that you create or click by clicking on the appropriate links
        below. If you would like to opt-out of the Bitly Links, please click on the opt-out choice for Bitly Links
        below. This will install a cookie on your browser that instructs our servers not to associate your IP address
        and browser with Bitly Links you create, click, or view. If you clear your cookies in your browser, you will
        need to click on the opt- out choice again after each time you clear your cookies. To be clear, these
        cookie-based opt-outs must be performed on each device and browser that you wish to have opted-out. Cookie-based
        opt-outs are not effective on mobile applications. However, on many mobile devices, application users may limit
        tracking via their device settings. Please note that if you use these opt-out mechanisms, we will still
        automatically collect the IP addresses of computers or mobile devices that click on or create Bitly Links; we
        just won’t associate them with your browser or Bitly account.</p>

    <p><strong>Note Regarding Children</strong><br /> We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If
        we learn that we have collected personal information of a child under 13 (or older as required by applicable
        law), we will take steps to delete such information from our ﬁles as soon as possible.</p>
    <h5 className="header-s">How We Use Information</h5>
    <p>We use the personal information we collect for a variety of administrative and business purposes to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li >operate our Site and provide the Services, process and complete any transactions,
            verify individual identity,</li>
        <li>respond to inquiries, questions and comments and provide customer and technical support, provide access to
            certain functionalities of our Services,</li>
        <li>personalize and improve the Services and develop new products and services,</li>
        <li>communicate with our current and prospective customers concerning our services, measure interest and
            engagement in our Site and Services,</li>
        <li>monitor and analyze usage and trends of the Site and Services,</li>
        <li>provide services to our customers to allow them to understand how you interact with our Services and to help
            detect, deter and prevent malicious, fraudulent or unlawful activity,</li>
        <li>comply with any legal obligations, and</li>
        <li>enforce our terms and as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Usage Across Devices</strong><br /> We may use the information we collect to make inferences that a unique
        individual has created or interacted with Bitly links on different devices so that we can detect, deter and
        prevent malicious, fraudulent or unlawful activity and analyze how users use our Services. For example, if you
        created a Bitly link on a computer connected to your residential WiFi network, and you soon thereafter clicked
        on a Bitly link on a mobile device connected to the same WiFi network, we may infer that a single individual
        created and clicked on the Bitly links because both events were associated with the same IP address in the same
        time period.</p>
    <p><strong>Other Legitimate Interests</strong><br /> We also may use personal information to pursue legitimate
        interests, such as direct marketing, research (including marketing research), network and information security,
        prevention of fraudulent, malicious and unlawful activities, or any other purpose disclosed to you at the time
        you provide personal information or allowed by law.</p>
    <h5 className="header-s">Information We Share</h5>
    <p>The Services are designed to help you share information with others. In addition, we provide Services to our
        Customers that use Bitly Link Metrics. As a result, the following categories of personal information generated
        through your use of the Services are shared publicly or with the following categories of third parties for the
        business purposes described below.</p>
    <p><strong>Bitly Links You Create</strong><br /> Much of your activity on and through the Services is public by
        default. For example, when you create a Bitly Link, the original URLs you have shortened and the corresponding
        Bitly Links are publicly available.</p>
    <p><strong>Account Information</strong><br /> Where permitted by law, if you register a Bitly Account with an email
        address on a domain owned by an organization, (for example, an employer or educational institution where you
        have an email account), we may share your email address and information about your Account, such as the number
        of links you have created, with that organization to explore the organization’s interest in creating or managing
        an enterprise account or for related purposes.</p>
    <p><strong>Information We Share With Customers</strong><br /> We may share the personal information we collect as
        described in this Privacy Policy with our customers. When you create a Bitly Link of one of our customer’s
        sites, the customer may be able to view the unshortened original URL, the date and time the Bitly Link was
        created, the location where it was created as derived from your IP address, and aggregated information about
        clicks and views of the Bitly Links, including the number of times the Bitly Link was shared, whether or not it
        was viewed, comparison of that Bitly Link’s performance to that of all Bitly Links pointing to the same content,
        whether others are sharing a Bitly Link to the same content, geographic regions where the content is being
        viewed, and identiﬁcation of social networks on which the Bitly Links appear. In addition, we may share Bitly
        Link Metrics with customers to help them detect, deter and prevent malicious, fraudulent or unlawful activity.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Information You Elect to Share</strong><br /> When creating a Bitly Link, you can share that Bitly Link
        through Third Party Services. Any information that you elect to distribute through Third Party Services, such as
        a social network post you create, may then become accessible to users of those services. You can also access
        other Third Party Services through the Services, for example by clicking on links in the Statistics page for a
        Bitly Link. We recommend that you review the terms of services and privacy policies of such Third Party Services
        that you access through the Services since Bitly does not control and is not responsible for the privacy
        practices of these Third Party Services.</p>
    <p><strong>Information Shared with Service Providers </strong><br /> We may employ and contract with third parties to
        perform certain tasks on our behalf and under our direction (our “Service Providers”). We may need to share
        information about you with our Service Providers in order to fulfill certain business purposes, like providing
        our product with research and analytics on user behavior and providing advertising products and services to
        users, processing payments, and providing email marketing and support services. Our agreements with these
        Service Providers authorize them to use your information only as necessary to provide services to us. Transfers
        to subsequent third parties are covered by our agreements with our service providers.</p>
    <p><strong>Information Disclosed Pursuant to Business Transfers</strong><br /> We may transfer and/or provide
        information about our users in connection with an acquisition, sale of company assets, or other situation where
        user information would be transferred as one of our business assets. You will be notiﬁed via email and/or a
        prominent notice on our website.</p>
    <p>In such a case, the acquirer of Bitly may continue to use your information as set forth in this policy or as
        otherwise allowed by law.</p>
    <p><strong>Information Disclosed for the Protection of Bitly and Others</strong><br /> Bitly may access, read,
        preserve, and disclose any information it collects when it has a good faith belief that doing so is reasonably
        necessary to (i) comply with a law, regulation, or compulsory legal request, including process from a
        governmental law enforcement or national security agency, (ii) enforce the Privacy Policy or Terms of Service,
        including investigation of potential violations hereof, (iii) detect, deter, prevent or otherwise address
        malicious, fraudulent or unlawful activity, (iv) respond to user support requests, or (v) protect the rights,
        property or safety of Bitly, its users and the public. This includes exchanging information with other companies
        and organizations for protection from malicious, fraudulent or unlawful activity.</p>
    <p><strong>Information We Share With Your Consent</strong><br /> We will share information about you when you direct
        or otherwise instruct us to do so, such as when you share Bitly Links or content with others through the
        Services, if you intentionally use or direct us or the Services to interact with third parties, or if we notify
        you that the information you provide will be shared in a particular manner and you provide such information
        (like sharing/posting it with a third-party Service).</p>
    <h2 className="header-s">INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS</h2>
    <p>Depending on your location, information about you may be transferred to the United States or other countries
        outside the EU or European Economic Area (EEA) or may be processed there. These data transfers are necessary to
        provide you with the services outlined in this policy.</p>
    <p>To protect your personal data, we rely on appropriate legal basis for each data transfer. In particular, we use
        contractual safeguards such as Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission. Where
        applicable, we base data transfers also on <a
            href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/adequacy-decisions_en"
            target="_blank" rel="noopener">adequacy decisions</a> issued by the European Commission.</p>
    <p>Please feel free to contact us for further information about international data transfers.</p>
    <h5 className="header-s">Retention</h5>
    <p>We retain the personal information we receive as described in this Privacy Policy for as long as you use our
        Services or as necessary to fulﬁll the purpose(s) for which it was collected, provide our Services, resolve
        disputes, establish legal defenses, conduct audits, pursue legitimate business purposes, enforce our agreements,
        and comply with applicable legal obligations.</p>
    <h5 className="header-s">Information Security</h5>
    <p>Your Account information is protected by a password for your privacy and security. You can help prevent
        unauthorized access to your Account by selecting and protecting your password appropriately, making use of
        two-factor authentication, and limiting access to your computer and browser by signing off after you have
        ﬁnished accessing your Account.</p>
    <p>Bitly endeavors to protect the information it collects about its users using reasonable security processes and
        controls, however, despite these efforts, no security measure is perfect or impenetrable and Bitly does not
        guarantee or warrant that such measures will prevent unauthorized access to the information about you that is
        stored by Bitly. In the event we experience a breach of security, we will promptly notify you if your personal
        information has been compromised, in accordance with applicable law. If you have any questions about the
        security of your personal information, you can contact us at <a
            href="mailto:privacy@bitly.com">privacy@bitly.com</a>.</p>
    <h5 className="header-s">Choice and Access</h5>
    <p>You don’t need an Account to create Bitly Links, and you can use many of the features of the Services without
        registering, thereby limiting the type of information that is collected about you individually. If you have a
        Bitly Account, you may access, correct, or request deletion of your personal information by logging into your
        Account. Once logged in to your account, you will be able to view a history of the URLs you have shortened and
        the metrics pages for those URLs. You can request a complete copy of the personal information we store about
        your account by clicking the button to request a report in your Account Settings. For more information on how to
        request access to your information, please see our <a
            href="https://support.bitly.com/hc/en-us/articles/360006534152-How-to-request-a-copy-of-my-personal-data-from-Bitly-GDPR-Subject-Access-Request-">help
            article</a>.</p>
    <p>You can delete your Account at any time through your Account settings page. If you delete your Account, you will
        no longer be able to access or use the Services. If you have an Account but are unable to access it, you can
        contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@bitly.com">privacy@bitly.com</a>. We will respond to your request within a
        reasonable timeframe. If you are a resident of the EEA or Switzerland, you have the right to ask that your
        personal data be corrected, updated, or erased. Additionally, you may have the right to access your personal
        data and receive a copy of your personal data undergoing processing. You may also have the right to object to,
        or request that we restrict, certain processing.</p>
    <p>For all other requests to exercise any of your rights, you may contact us as indicated in the “Questions” section
        below. Once we receive your request, we will ask that you verify your identity such as by authenticating through
        your account. If you do not have a Bitly account, Bitly has no way of identifying you or verifying that you
        created or clicked on a Bitly link.</p>
    <p>You may be entitled, in accordance with applicable law, to submit a request through an authorized agent. To
        designate an authorized agent to exercise your rights and choices on your behalf, please provide a written
        attestation, declaration, or permission that has either been physically signed or provided electronically per
        applicable law. In certain circumstances, we may be required by law to retain your personal information.</p>
    <p>Please note that in the interest of ensuring that existing Bitly Links continue to function for all of our users,
        the Bitly Links that you have created and shared cannot be deleted or disabled (even if your Account is
        deleted), and any shortening and sharing activity that has already occurred on your Account also cannot be
        deleted. If you have concerns about any unauthorized use of your Account, you can delete your account within
        your Account settings.</p>
    <p>Please see the Cookies section above for additional choices you may have.</p>
    <h5 className="header-s">California Residents</h5>
    <p>If you are a California Resident, you may request, subject to any applicable exceptions, access to and deletion
        of your information or more information about how we collect, use, and disclose personal information. You may
        submit a verifiable request to know and exercise any of your other rights as described in the “Choice and
        Access” section above. We will not discriminate against you for exercising your rights and choices.</p>
    <p>The categories of personal information that we have collected in the preceding 12 months and their sources are
        provided in the “Information We Collect” section above. Our business purposes for collecting personal
        information are described in the “How We Use Information” section above.</p>
    <p>Bitly does not sell your personal information to third parties for money or other valuable consideration. Bitly
        does permit third parties to collect the information described above through our Service and discloses such
