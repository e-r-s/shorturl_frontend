                    no obligation to run, provide or support legacy versions of the #1ShortUrl Services.</li>
                <li><b>#1ShortUrl Enterprise Customers.</b>&nbsp;If you have purchased a #1ShortUrl Enterprise Plan, these terms
                    may be supplemented or modified by a supplemental enterprise agreement and one or more order forms,
                    the terms of which will control to the extent they conflict with these Terms.</li>
                <li><b>Support, Uptime &amp; Training.</b>&nbsp;The training and level of customer support for the tier
                    of #1ShortUrl Services you purchase is set forth on the #1ShortUrl Services pricing page.</li>

        </li>
        <li><u>PAID ACCOUNTS</u>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Fees.</b>&nbsp;#1ShortUrl offers fee-based #1ShortUrl Services that provide additional features and
                    functionality. Pricing and services for paid accounts are described on #1ShortUrl’s Services pricing page
                    and may be updated from time to time. If you sign up for a paid account, you agree to pay #1ShortUrl all
                    applicable fees for the tier of #1ShortUrl Services according to your selection. Fees are non-refundable
                    except as required by law or as otherwise specifically permitted in this Agreement.</li>
                <li><b>Auto-renewals and Trials.</b>&nbsp;If your account is set to auto-renew or is in a trial period
                    and you have already provided a method of payment to #1ShortUrl for the Services, #1ShortUrl will charge your
                    payment account automatically at the end of the trial or beginning of each renewal term for the
                    renewal term, unless you notify us that you want to cancel or disable auto-renewal before the
                    expiration of the then-current term. You may terminate the Agreement in your account’s Account
                    Details page, or, if you purchased your Service through a #1ShortUrl account representative by contacting

                    longer, we will notify you within 30 days before your account renews, including any changes in the
                    Fees for the plan.</li>
                <li><b>Payment.</b>&nbsp;Customer will pay #1ShortUrl invoices on the payment interval selected. If not
                    otherwise specified, payments will be due immediately. Customer authorizes #1ShortUrl to charge Customer

                    platform. Customer will provide complete and accurate billing and contact information to #1ShortUrl.

                    finance charge of one percent (1.5%) per month (18% per annum), or the maximum permitted by law,
                    whichever is lower, plus all expenses of collection, including reasonable attorneys’ fees.</li>
                <li><b>Taxes.</b>&nbsp;Fees are exclusive of taxes, duties, levies, tariffs, and other governmental
                    charges (collectively, “Taxes”), and Customer is responsible for all Taxes resulting from this
                    Agreement or Customer’s use of the #1ShortUrl Services. #1ShortUrl will invoice Customer for Taxes when
                    required to do so by applicable law, and Customer agrees to provide payment under the terms of the
                    invoice. In the event Customer is required by law to deduct and withhold any Taxes on amounts
                    payable under this Agreement, any amounts required to be withheld will be promptly deducted and
                    timely remitted by the Customer on behalf of #1ShortUrl to the appropriate taxation authority and
                    Customer agrees that it will provide #1ShortUrl with copies of all necessary documents (including but not
                    limited to tax receipts received from the applicable tax authority) in order for #1ShortUrl to claim and
                    receive a foreign tax credit in an amount corresponding to the amount withheld by the Customer.</li>
                <li><b>Downgrades.</b>&nbsp;#1ShortUrl reserves the right to downgrade, suspend or terminate Customer’s
                    access to any or all #1ShortUrl Services if Fees are past due.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li><u>LICENSE, METRICS AND COMPLIANCE;</u>
            <ol>
                <li><b>License to #1ShortUrl Services.</b>&nbsp;Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and
                    payment of all Fees due hereunder, #1ShortUrl grants Customer, and any other party agreed in an Order
                    Form, a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, non-transferable right and license to
                    use the #1ShortUrl Services solely to shorten uniform resource locators (“URL”), receive certain #1ShortUrl
                    Link Metrics (defined in #1ShortUrl’s&nbsp;<a href="/privacy" target="_blank"
                        rel="noopener">Privacy Policy</a>) and, for Enterprise Plan Customers, to utilize the other
                    products and services defined on the applicable Order Form during the Term.</li>
                <li><b>#1ShortUrl Link Metrics.</b>&nbsp;As part of the provision of #1ShortUrl Services, #1ShortUrl collects and
                    generates #1ShortUrl Link Metrics, which are described in #1ShortUrl’s&nbsp;<a
                        href="/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Privacy Policy</a>.
                    Certain, limited #1ShortUrl Link Metrics are published on #1ShortUrl’s website. Customer acknowledges and
                    agrees that all #1ShortUrl Link Metrics are owned by #1ShortUrl, and that #1ShortUrl has the right to use, license,
                    sell or otherwise dispose of #1ShortUrl Link Metrics as detailed in #1ShortUrl’s&nbsp;<a
                        href="/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Privacy Policy</a>. #1ShortUrl
                    does not make all #1ShortUrl Link Metrics available to Customer. Customer may access, use, and copy the
                    limited #1ShortUrl Link Metrics we make available to Customer according to the Customer’s service tier.
                    Customer may not combine any #1ShortUrl Link Metrics with any personally identifiable information and may
                    not sublicense, sell, syndicate or otherwise share #1ShortUrl Link Metrics with any third party.</li>
                <li><b>Access Credentials.</b>&nbsp;#1ShortUrl shall provide Customer with non-transferable access
                    credentials for the #1ShortUrl Services. Customer shall not (i) misrepresent or mask identities when
                    using the #1ShortUrl Services or seeking access credentials; (ii) select or use as a username or Branded
                    Short Domain a name subject to any rights of a person or entity other than Customer without
                    appropriate authorization; (iii) select or use, as Customer’s username or Branded Short Domain, a
                    name that is otherwise offensive, vulgar or obscene; or (iv) exceed any access permitted by #1ShortUrl.
                    Customer shall safeguard all access credentials provided by #1ShortUrl and shall ensure the
                    confidentiality and security thereof. To the extent Customer is a corporate entity rather than an
                    individual (1) only employees and contractors of Customer (“Personnel”) may use the #1ShortUrl Services;
                    (2) Customer shall require its Personnel to comply with all Laws and the use restrictions (including
                    user seat restrictions) set out in the Agreement or otherwise prescribed by #1ShortUrl and shall not
                    share access credentials to exceed the user limitations of the service tier Customer has purchased;
                    (3) Customer represents and warrants that its Personnel have the capacity and authority to enter
                    into this Agreement; and (4) Customer acknowledges that it shall be fully responsible for any acts
                    or omissions of its Personnel, whether authorized or unauthorized. #1ShortUrl may update, refresh or
                    change the manner of accessing the #1ShortUrl Services in its discretion.</li>
                <li><b>Compliance Monitoring.</b>&nbsp;#1ShortUrl may monitor Customer’s use of the #1ShortUrl Services for
                    compliance with the Agreement. If #1ShortUrl observes usage of the #1ShortUrl Services that it believes are
                    not in compliance with the Agreement, #1ShortUrl will notify the Customer and give the Customer five (5)
                    business days to remedy its non-compliance. If Customer does not remedy its non-compliance within
                    five (5) business days, #1ShortUrl reserves the right to suspend or terminate Customer’s use of the #1ShortUrl
                    Services. #1ShortUrl reserves the right to suspend Customer’s use of the #1ShortUrl Services without notice in
                    the event that it believes, in good faith, the security of Customer’s #1ShortUrl account has been
                    compromised, or the Customer’s #1ShortUrl account is being used for an unlawful purpose. And may suspend
                    or terminate Customer’s access to the Services without notice for violation of the Agreement.</li>

        <li><u>INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY &amp; LICENSE RESTRICTIONS</u>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Ownership.</b>&nbsp;Except for any Customer Content or Customer Services, Customer acknowledges
                    and agrees that #1ShortUrl is the sole and exclusive owner of all right, title and interest in and to the

                    intellectual property, and all derivatives, enhancements, modifications and improvements thereof
                    (“#1ShortUrl Materials”). Nothing in this Agreement or any other document shall be deemed to transfer
                    ownership of the #1ShortUrl Materials. Except for the limited license rights expressly granted herein, no
                    rights to #1ShortUrl Materials are granted hereunder and all rights in such #1ShortUrl Materials are reserved.

                <li><b>Feedback.</b>&nbsp;Customer is not required to provide any suggestions, enhancement requests,
                    recommendations or other feedback regarding the #1ShortUrl Services or #1ShortUrl Link Metrics (“Feedback”).
                    However, if Customer does so, all right, title and interest in and to such Feedback shall be
                    assigned to, and shall become the sole and exclusive property of, #1ShortUrl upon its creation.</li>
                <li><b>License Restrictions.</b>&nbsp;Customer shall not share access credentials to exceed the user
                    limitations of the service tier Customer has purchased. Customer and its Personnel shall not, and
                    shall not permit any third party to: (i) access the Services or export data from the Services to
                    create a service, software, documentation or data for a URL shortening service other than #1ShortUrl or
                    create shortened links or a service that is competitive with, substantially similar or confusingly
                    similar to any aspect of the #1ShortUrl Services or #1ShortUrl Link Metrics; (ii) use, modify, display,
                    perform, copy, disclose or create derivative works of the #1ShortUrl Services except as expressly
                    permitted herein; (iii) reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, mimic, screen-scrape, frame or
                    mirror the #1ShortUrl Services or #1ShortUrl Link Metrics, or use any other means to attempt to discover their

                    assign, share, sell, rent, lease, pledge or otherwise transfer the #1ShortUrl Services or #1ShortUrl Link
                    Metrics to any third party; (v) transmit harmful, disabling or malicious code or devices, or
                    infringing, defamatory, unlawful, tortious, deceptive, misleading, fraudulent, abusive, indecent or
                    otherwise offensive content, or content that contains someone’s personal information or violates a
                    third party’s intellectual property, privacy or publicity rights (“Prohibited Content”) through the
                    #1ShortUrl Services; (vi) access via automated or unauthorized means, interfere with, disrupt or attempt
                    to monitor, override access or circumvent security measures for, the #1ShortUrl Services or #1ShortUrl Link
                    Metrics or related systems, including via robots, spiders and other electronic methods; and (vii)
                    obscure, remove or alter any proprietary rights or other notices on the #1ShortUrl Services or #1ShortUrl Link
                    Metrics. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, #1ShortUrl may, in its sole discretion,
                    immediately revoke the grant of rights set forth in Section 3 if Customer breaches or threatens to
                    breach the restrictions in this Section or creates other security or legal concerns. Customer hereby
                    agrees that #1ShortUrl will be entitled, in addition to any other remedies available to it at law or in
                    equity, to injunctive relief to prevent the breach or threatened breach of Customer’s obligations
                    under this Section, without any requirement to demonstrate irreparable harm or post a bond.</li>
                <li><b>Technical Restrictions.</b>&nbsp;Customer shall not exceed the number and/or frequency of API
                    calls, concurrent URL shortens or other access to or use of #1ShortUrl Services in the relevant
                    documentation or as otherwise provided by #1ShortUrl in an Order Form. If #1ShortUrl believes that Customer
                    has attempted to exceed or circumvent these limitations, #1ShortUrl may suspend or block Customer’s
                    access to the #1ShortUrl Services. #1ShortUrl may monitor Customer’s use of the #1ShortUrl Services, including to
                    ensure Customer’s compliance with this Agreement.</li>
                <li><b>Open Source Software.</b>&nbsp;#1ShortUrl Services may incorporate software that is subject to terms
                    that, as a condition of use, copying, modification or redistribution, require such software and
                    derivative works thereof to be disclosed or distributed in source code form, to be licensed for the
                    purpose of making derivative works, or to be redistributed free of charge (“Open Source Software”).
                    To the extent any Open Source Software license terms are inconsistent with this Agreement, then such
                    rights in the applicable Open Source Software license shall take precedence over the rights granted
                    in this Agreement, but solely with respect to such Open Source Software. Any applicable Open Source
                    Software license is solely between Customer and the applicable licensor of the Open Source Software
                    and Customer shall comply with the applicable Open Source Software license.</li>
                <li><b>Third Party Materials.</b>&nbsp;#1ShortUrl Services may utilize third party software or source code,
                    including without limitation Open Source Software (“Third Party Materials”). #1ShortUrl has no control
                    over Third Party Materials. Accordingly, #1ShortUrl is not responsible or liable for any Third Party
                    Materials. While #1ShortUrl has no obligation to monitor Third Party Materials, #1ShortUrl may remove or
                    modify such Third Party Materials in its discretion, including without limitation to comply with
                    Law. Customer agrees to comply with all terms and conditions and privacy policies related to any
                    Third Party Materials.</li>
                <li><b>Trademarks.</b>&nbsp;#1ShortUrl grants Customer a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable,
                    non-sublicensable license to access and use #1ShortUrl’s names, logos, designs, and other trademarks
                    incorporated into the #1ShortUrl Services (“#1ShortUrl Marks”) during the Term and solely for the purposes of
                    displaying such notice as part of the #1ShortUrl Services. Customer recognizes the validity of the #1ShortUrl
                    Marks and #1ShortUrl’s ownership and title thereto. Any goodwill derived from the use of the #1ShortUrl Marks
                    by Customer shall inure to the benefit #1ShortUrl. Customer will not challenge the #1ShortUrl Marks, or
                    #1ShortUrl’s ownership and title thereto, or the USPTO application or registration thereof, either during
                    or subsequent to the term of this Agreement. Customer shall execute such documents as may be
                    reasonably requested by #1ShortUrl, or required by law, to establish #1ShortUrl’s sole and exclusive ownership
                    and rights in the #1ShortUrl Marks, or to obtain registration thereof. Customer agrees to use the #1ShortUrl
                    Marks consistent with #1ShortUrl’s Brand Assets it makes available at&nbsp;<a

                            Rules. The AAA Rules are available at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.adr.org/" target="_blank"
                                rel="noopener">www.adr.org</a>&nbsp;or by calling 1-800-778-7879. A party who wishes to
                            start arbitration must submit a written Demand for Arbitration to AAA and give notice to the
                            other party as specified in the AAA Rules. The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration
                            at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.adr.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.adr.org</a>.</li>
                        <li>If your claim is for U.S. $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be
                            conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic
                            or video-conference hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If
                            your claim exceeds U.S. $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules.
                            Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) where you live, unless we
                            both agree to a different location. The parties agree that the arbitrator shall have
                            exclusive authority to decide all issues relating to the interpretation, applicability,
                            enforceability and scope of this arbitration agreement.</li>
                        <li>Arbitration Costs. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be

                            administration and arbitrator fees and expenses if your Dispute is for less than $10,000,
                            unless the arbitrator finds your Dispute frivolous. If we prevail in arbitration we’ll pay
                            all of our attorneys’ fees and costs and won’t seek to recover them from you. If you prevail
                            in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses to the
                            extent provided under applicable law.</li>
                        <li>Class Action Waiver. YOU AND #1ShortUrl AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY
                            IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED
                            CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, if the parties’ dispute is resolved through
                            arbitration, the arbitrator may not consolidate another person’s claims with your claims,
                            and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If this
                            specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Dispute
                            Resolution section shall be null and void.</li>

                            (“Class Action Waiver”), if an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction decides that
                            any part of these Terms of Service is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of these
                            Terms of Service will still apply.</li>

                <li><b>Relationship of the Parties.</b>&nbsp;The parties shall be independent contractors under this
                    Agreement, and nothing herein will constitute either party as the employer, employee, agent or
                    representative of the other party, or both parties as joint venturers or partners for any purpose.
                </li>
                <li><b>Entire Agreement and Severability.</b>&nbsp;This Agreement is the entire agreement between the
                    parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous
                    communications and proposals (whether oral, written or electronic) between the parties with respect
                    thereto, including any non-disclosure agreements signed by the parties. Except as may be modified in
                    writing by the parties, including by a #1ShortUrl Enterprise Supplemental Agreement, no additional or
                    conflicting terms set out on Customer order, invoice, statement or other document, or contained in
                    any “shrinkwrap” or “clickwrap” agreements, are binding. If any provision of this Agreement is found
                    to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent
                    necessary so that this Agreement will otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.
                </li>
                <li><b>Force Majeure.</b>&nbsp;Except for any Fees due hereunder, neither party shall not be liable for
                    any delay in performing or failure to perform its obligations hereunder where such delay or failure
                    results from any cause beyond its reasonable control, including, without limitation, cyber-attacks,
                    mechanical, electronic or communications failures, acts of God, terrorism, war, natural disasters,
                    failure of any telecommunications or transportation or of any third party provider or supplier
                    (e.g., host or app store providers) or labor disputes.</li>
                <li><b>Assignment.</b>&nbsp;Except to an affiliate or in the event of a merger, acquisition or other
                    change of control, neither party may assign this Agreement without the prior written permission of
                    the other party, and any attempt to do so is void. This Agreement shall be binding on any permitted
                    successors and assigns.</li>
                <li><b>Notices.</b>&nbsp;Unless otherwise specified in this Agreement, all notices under this Agreement
                    will be in writing to the addresses listed above and will be deemed to have been duly given when
                    received, if personally delivered; when sent, if transmitted by facsimile or e-mail; or the day
                    after it is sent, if sent for next day delivery by recognized overnight delivery service.</li>
                <li><b>Headings; Interpretation.</b>&nbsp;The section and paragraph headings in this Agreement are for
                    convenience only and shall not affect their interpretation. Any use of “including” “for example” or
                    “such as” in this Agreement shall be read as being followed by “without limitation.”</li>
                <li><b>Export.</b>&nbsp;The parties shall comply with all applicable export and import control laws and
                    regulations, and, in particular, shall not export or re-export the #1ShortUrl Services without all
                    required United States and foreign government licenses.</li>
                <li><b>Government Use.</b>&nbsp;The #1ShortUrl Services are “commercial items” as that term is defined at 48
                    C.F.R. 2.101, consisting of “commercial computer software” and “commercial computer software
                    documentation” as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212. Any access to or use of the #1ShortUrl
                    Services by any government entity is prohibited, except as expressly permitted by the terms of this
                    Agreement. Additionally, any use by U.S. government entities must be in accordance with 48 C.F.R.
                    12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4. If Customer uses the #1ShortUrl Services in its
                    official capacity as an employee or representative of a U.S., state or local government entity and
                    is legally unable to accept the indemnity, jurisdiction, venue or other clauses herein, then those
                    clauses do not apply to such entity, but only to the extent as required by applicable law.</li>
                <li><b>General.</b>&nbsp;The failure of #1ShortUrl to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not
                    constitute a waiver of future enforcement of that right or provision. The waiver of any such right
                    or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of
                    #1ShortUrl. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its
                    remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or
                    otherwise. If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of these Terms
                    invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the
                    other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.</li>
                <li><b>Publicity.</b>&nbsp;Customer grants #1ShortUrl the right to use Customer’s logos or trademarks in
                    marketing or publicity materials and on its website to identify Customer as a customer that uses the
                    #1ShortUrl Services.</li>
                <li><b>Contacting #1ShortUrl.</b>&nbsp;If you have any questions about these Terms, please contact us
